\subsection{Web Hosting}

Linux is best know for running most of the world's web servers, so it would make sense for LUG UoA to host their own web content such as registration form, git repository and website. The club currently has a couple of idle Raspberry Pis which can fullfill this purpose.

\subsubsection*{Skills involved}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Internet basics, knowledge of http, NAT, ports, IP tables etc
    \item Some form of server programming, i.e. php with apache/nginx
    \item Running and maintaining a database
    \item Cyber security
    \item Searching up how to do things online
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Time Commitment}
unknown, but core features should be easy and quick to implement, while the implementation of additional ones are flexible

\subsubsection*{Key Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item hands on experience with web technologies on linux
    \item LUG can move away from big-corp products and services
    \item We could have our own email addresses such as: \\*
    "f***microsoft\_personal\_opinion\_not\_endorsedbyLUG@lug.ac"
\end{itemize}
